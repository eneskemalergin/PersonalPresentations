# Tutorials

## How to Convert Ipython file into the slides

```
$ jupyter nbconvert <name.ipynb> --to slides --post serve
```

- Then it will run on the local host perfectly.  (If you don't know how to make slides in notebook check out my [presentation](https://github.com/eneskemalergin/PersonalPresentations/blob/master/Presentations_with_Ipython.ipynb) on that)

## Setup-Jupyter

### For Linux :
```
sudo apt-get install python-pip
pip install jupyter
```

### For Mac :
```
sudo easy_install pip
pip install jupyter
```

### For Windows:
Download the latest versions of the python 2/3 and they will come with pip installed, then:
